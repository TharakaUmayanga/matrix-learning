# matrix-learning

I'm planing to implement several machine algorithms from scratch,  including:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* K-Means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Neural Networks (e.g. Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network)
