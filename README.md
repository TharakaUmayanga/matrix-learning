# matrix-learning
Welcome to my pet project on machine learning! This repository is dedicated to my journey in understanding the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms.

Through this project, I aim to implement various machine learning techniques and understand how they work under the hood. The code in this repository is written in Python and Numpy.

In this repository, you will find code for a variety of machine learning, including regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. Each task is accompanied by detailed explanations of the underlying algorithms, helping to demystify the world of machine learning.



I'm planing to implement several machine algorithms from scratch,  including:

### Classification
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Regression

* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression 
* Decision Tree Regression 
* Random Forest
* KNN Model 
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Gaussian Regression
* Polynomial Regression

### Clustering Algorithms

* Affinity Propagation
* Agglomerative Clustering
* BIRCH
* DBSCAN
* K-Means
* Mini-Batch K-Means
* Mean Shift
* OPTICS
* Spectral Clustering

### Deep Learning
* Neural Networks
